## Option A - Cloning Repo from GitHub

choose a clean working directory - make sure the Git command is installed on your system! for tutorial purposes we will work in a directory called `/code`

`git clone https://github.com/ADGSTUDIOS/OpenMusic`

now move into the `/code/OpenMusic` directory

## Option B - Forking

you could fork the repo and modify files on GitHub/ clone from your repo if you would like. Feel Free to do so!


## File Structure
you should have the following files

    assets      # Consists of all Website files consisting of CSS,SCSS,fonts,images and JavaScript folders consisting files which builds up the web player.
    index.html  # The Web Player front end html file.
    ...         # Other (song files / cover artwork) folders can be added!

once done you can proceed to the next step!
