## Testing Application
well you can just open `index.html` in your web browser.

hopefully everything works as expected! if no songs are rendered then you have made an oopsie. Go back to the config page and fix your mistakes!

proceed to deployment if happy with everything.

## Software Engineering
Skip this step if you are not a developer! but im assuming you are because you are using GitHub and this is a very technical doc to follow.

If you are a front-end engineer you can make changes to `index.html` and `/static/css/style.css` for front-end stuff.
Please pull request to this repo on GitHub if you got amazing changes to UI/Fixing Bugs/Animations etc.

If you are a back-end guy who messes with JavaScript.
`/static/js/search.js` and `/static/js/script.js` will tickle your fantasy.

If you are full-stack like me let your creativity run wild!

I am leaving it up for your to build this OpenSource masterpiece.

proceed to deployment if happy with everything.
